abstract: CAScape is a 2D escape platformer game created using GB Studio. The goal of the project is to build a short but challenging game inspired by earthquake scenarios and our school dog, CASie. CAScape includes three main levels with obstacles such as spikes, bombs, and appearing floor gaps. The game features player movement, collision detection, hazards, scene transitions, dialogues, simple UI, sound effects, and background art. Most of the planned features were completed, resulting in a playable demo with about 98% of the intended mechanics implemented. The game meets the main project goals and provides a fun but rage-baiting experience.
