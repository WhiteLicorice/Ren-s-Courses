abstract: WODO (WASM-Optimized Do Organizer) is a browser-installable, offline-capable To-Do List system built using WebAssembly (C → WASM), minimal Clay CSS UI, and a Progressive Web App (PWA) architecture. The project demonstrates full integration of C logic compiled to WebAssembly, persistent storage using JavaScript bridges and browser localStorage, a modern UI using Clay CSS-inspired components, offline fallback and caching through a service worker, and deployment on GitHub Pages as a fully functional PWA. WODO fulfills the requirements of Weeks 1–4 of the CMSC 131 final project by demonstrating WebAssembly fundamentals, JS–C communication, UI integration, and web deployment.
