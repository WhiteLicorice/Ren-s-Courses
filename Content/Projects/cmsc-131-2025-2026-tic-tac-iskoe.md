abstract: Tic-Tac-ISKOe is a Game Boy–style recreation of the classic tic-tac-toe game, developed in GB Studio to explore compact game design within a limited 8-bit environment. The project aims to reimplement a familiar grid-based game while examining how its mechanics—turn alternation, board interaction, and automated win or draw detection—can be modeled through event-driven logic. Featuring a retro-inspired interface with binary markers (1s and 0s) that reflect the developers' computer science background, the game includes responsive two-player interaction and integrated audio with background music and sound effects. It relies on GB Studio's variable and scene systems to manage board states, player turns, and game flow, while incorporating a thematic nod to binary notation that adds a layer of originality to the classic design. The final product presents a fully playable and visually consistent mini-game that demonstrates how traditional mechanics can be adapted to a constrained development tool while maintaining clarity, coherence, and functional gameplay.
