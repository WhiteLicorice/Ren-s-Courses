abstract: Flappy Byte is a Game Boy Advance (GBA) homebrew project that reimagines the classic Flappy Bird mechanic through the lens of digital logic and low-level programming. Written entirely in C using tonclib, the game challenges players to navigate a bouncing ball through scrolling pipes while simultaneously solving 8-bit logic-gate puzzles in real time. Each pipe set displays two possible byte outputs, one correct and one decoy, based on a randomized combination of a game byte, a secondary byte, and a logic gate (AND, OR, XOR, or NOT). The player must mentally compute the correct result before the pipes reach the ball's position. This project demonstrates low-level graphics manipulation, sprite management, timing loops, memory organization, collision detection on the GBA. The outcome is a fully playable, original, and educational puzzle-arcade hybrid that successfully blends reflex-based gameplay with mental reasoning.
