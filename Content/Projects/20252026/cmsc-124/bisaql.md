abstract: "Bisaya Quality Language or BisaQL is a beginner-friendly programming language that is purely in Bisaya. The type of Bisaya this language uses is “Davao Bisaya,” making every line sound like how a Dabawenyo would talk. It’s designed for everyone who wants to learn Bisaya and those who already speak Bisaya. It helps programming become a lot more understandable and familiar as it uses words that are used by most target users."
