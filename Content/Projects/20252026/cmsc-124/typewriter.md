abstract: "The language takes itself from a lot of references such as java/C/python but strays from their syntaxing, this truly elegant language is made to support people who find it difficult to handle technicalities and coding but excel in understanding proper language and grammar. It closely mimics how common sentences are formed and structured, requiring only proper reading comprehension skill to master it."
