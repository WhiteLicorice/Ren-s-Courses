abstract: "The language takes itself from a lot of references such as java/C/python but strays from their syntaxing, this truly elegant language is made to support people who find it difficult to handle technicalities and coding but excel in understanding proper language and grammar. “Say goodbye to being a Master Coder, now be an Eloquent Writer.” It closely mimics how common sentences are formed and structured, not on a 1 to 1 basis, as it would prove difficult to do but as it closely mirrors proper grammar, one must only need a proper reading comprehension skill to master it."
