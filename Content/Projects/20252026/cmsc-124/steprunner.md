abstract: StepRunner is a pre-programming language for absolute beginners. Programs run top-down in numbered steps and use five core verbs — remember, say, ask, change, check — so learners grasp sequence → choice → repetition → memory without syntax noise. Blocks close with words (end check, end repeat). Conditions are plain English (equals, greater than, less than, optional is even/odd). No braces, no nested expressions, minimal symbols.
