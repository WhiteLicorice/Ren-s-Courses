abstract: TacShooter DSL (TSCL) is a specialized domain-specific language designed to let game designers and non-programmers configure the core elements of a 5v5 tactical shooter. Unlike general-purpose scripting languages, TSCL is declarative and data-driven. It allows users to define complex game entities—such as Agents, Weapons, Maps, and Status Effects—using a readable syntax that compiles directly into JSON for use in game engines. By supporting domain-specific literals and compiling directly to JSON, it eliminates common data entry errors and ensures that game content remains portable and engine-agnostic.
