abstract: "Byte-bayin is a programming language inspired by COBOL's verbose syntax and the Filipino Language. It is designed for young Filipinos who want to learn programming using the Filipino language. Just like COBOL, the syntax is a little bit verbose but at the same time it is also concise just like other modern programming language like Python."
