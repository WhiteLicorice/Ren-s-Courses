abstract: "The 5v5 TacShooter DSL is a hybrid programming environment for game development. It features two distinct modes: Lox Mode (Imperative) for general-purpose logic and calculations, and TacShooter DSL Mode (Declarative) for defining tactical shooter entities (Agents, Weapons, Maps). The declarative mode is optimized for high-level configuration and compiles directly into JSON for consumption by external game engines."
