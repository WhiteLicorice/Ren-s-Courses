abstract: "MOBA Unity Engine DSL (often shortened to MOBA DSL) is a domain-specific language for defining complete MOBA-style games on top of the Unity C# engine. It is designed so non-programmers (e.g., designers, game balancers) can describe heroes, abilities, items, creeps, arenas, and status effects in a declarative, designer-friendly way while the underlying engine handles execution."
