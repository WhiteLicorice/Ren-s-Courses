abstract: "MOBA Unity Engine DSL is a domain-specific language for defining complete MOBA-style games on top of the Unity C# engine. It is designed so non-programmers can describe heroes, abilities, items, creeps, and status effects in a declarative, designer-friendly way. Complex behaviors are composed as pipelines of effects using the |> operator, promoting readability and fast iteration."
