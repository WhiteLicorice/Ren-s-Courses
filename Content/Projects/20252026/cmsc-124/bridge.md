abstract: Bridge is a general-purpose, flexible, modern programming language designed to combine readable syntax, expressive control flow, hybrid typing (implicit & explicit), simplified error handling, unified looping syntax, and functional-style inline rules (condition -> result). Bridge aims to feel familiar to Python, JavaScript, C, and modern DSLs while offering unique language constructs such as when conditional blocks, inline match-like expressions, triple-mode loops (while, for, do-while) via loop, and inline or block-based catch handlers. Bridge uses curly braces for all blocks.
