abstract: BattleScript is an interpreted, domain-specific language (DSL) designed for simulating MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) game mechanics, specifically inspired by Dota 2. It allows users to script combat scenarios, calculate economy (GPM/XPM), and automate hero logic using terminology familiar to gamers. The language is built on Kotlin and features a recursive descent parser and a tree-walk interpreter. It supports dynamic typing, custom function definitions (Spells), and game-state management through a distinct syntax that replaces standard programming jargon with game macro-management terms.
