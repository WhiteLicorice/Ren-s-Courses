abstract: The PyCraft Programming language is a Python-inspired language designed to mimic how command lines work in Minecraft. Its purpose is to serve as an experimental language and expand on how Minecraft commands already function. It serves as a gamified version of the Python language, encouraging those familiar with Minecraft to engage in programming and explore coding. AS much as the language is built on the foundations of Minecraft, some coding conventions override these rules for better readability.
