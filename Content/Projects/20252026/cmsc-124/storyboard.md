abstract: "Storyboard is a functional programming language designed to promote clarity, immutability, and safe computation. It focuses more in a general-purpose language centered around pure functions, expression-driven evaluation, and strict value encapsulation. Inspired by the readability of Python and the mathematical precision of functional languages, Storyboard disallows mutable shared state and prevents values from being accessed outside their defining scope. This ensures that programs are predictable, side-effect-free, and easier for beginners to reason about. Storyboard is particularly suited for learning foundational programming concepts, modeling computations, transforming data, building pipelines, and writing small, verifiable programs. By emphasizing pure functions, lexical scoping, and human-readable syntax, Storyboard offers a gentle entry point into functional programming while still enabling expressive and structured problem solving."
