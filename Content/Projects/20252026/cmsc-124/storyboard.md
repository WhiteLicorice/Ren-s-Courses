abstract: "Storyboard is a functional programming language designed to promote clarity, immutability, and safe computation. It is inspired by both the readability of Python, the precision of functional languages, and the structure of film directing. Just as movies are organized into scenes, actors, and takes, Storyboard maps these cinematic concepts into programming constructs—making code feel like writing a script. This design helps beginners visualize program flow as a sequence of controlled, well-defined steps. Storyboard disallows mutable shared state and prevents values from being accessed outside their defining scope, ensuring predictable, side-effect-free execution. It is particularly suited for learning foundational programming concepts, modeling computations, transforming data, and writing small, verifiable programs. By emphasizing pure functions, clear structure, and human-readable syntax, Storyboard offers a gentle, narrative-inspired entry point into functional programming."
