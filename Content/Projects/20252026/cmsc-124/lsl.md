abstract: "LSL is an experimental domain-specific programming language designed to script League of Legends champion behavior and game mechanics. Its main characteristics are: Game-centric syntax with LoL-specific keywords (e.g., cast, attack, onAbilityCast), emphasis on clarity for competitive gaming strategy with readable operators and event-driven architecture, and Object-oriented design with game entities (Champions, Abilities, Items, Buffs)."
