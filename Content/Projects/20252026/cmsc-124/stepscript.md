abstract: StepScript is a beginner-friendly programming language modeled after the clarity and flow of cookbook instructions. Its syntax emphasizes readability, step-by-step logic, and natural phrasing. Instead of symbolic expressions, StepScript uses intuitive keywords such as Mix, Take away, Flip, and Check if to guide new programmers through common computational operations. The language supports variable declarations written in a conversational style, straightforward control flow structures, natural-language expressions, and recipe-like function definitions. Its goal is to enable learners to write programs without the cognitive load of strict or cryptic syntax.
