title: Point
authors:
  - Adriel Neyro Caraig
abstract: ">.< or Point is a functional programming language designed to take advantage of arrows (>>, =>, ->, ~>) as operators. The most important symbol, though, is '>>', or the forwarder operator, as it allows the user to pass the value from its left side as the first argument of the function being called on its right side. This feature aims to improve the readability of chained functions, representing them as an easily traceable pipeline."
