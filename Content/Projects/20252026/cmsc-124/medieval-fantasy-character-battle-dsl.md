title: Medieval Fantasy Character Battle DSL
authors:
  - Eryl Joseph Aspera
  - Antonio Gabriel Salmon
abstract: "This interpreter implements a domain-specific language (DSL) for tabletop RPG character creation and scripted simulations, primarily focused on generating fantasy characters and running automated battles. The language supports two main sections: declarative character sheets starting with the CHARACTER keyword and an optional imperative script section for general-purpose programming. It combines structured RPG data parsing with a Lox-like expression language for logic and control flow."
