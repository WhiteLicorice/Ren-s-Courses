title: Sudoku Web Game
authors:
  - Leona Mae Blancaflor
abstract: This project presents the development of a Web-based Sudoku game implemented entirely in the C programming language and deployed as WebAssembly. Sudoku puzzles are generated using recursive backtracking algorithm and a hole-digging difficulty model, ensuring each board is solvable and contains a unique solution. The user interface combines CLAY for structured layouting and Raylib for rendering and input handling. The game is deployable both locally and on the web. Through testing, including unit, integration, and system-level assessments, the project meets its objectives of functional reliability, consistent rendering, and user interaction accuracy.
