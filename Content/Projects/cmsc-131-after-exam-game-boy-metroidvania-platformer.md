abstract: After-Exam is a 2D action-platformer Game Boy game developed using GB Studio and inspired by the Metroidvania genre. The project applies concepts from game logic and hardware-constrained programming by implementing movement, combat, enemy behavior, and a boss fight built around a hexadecimal-to-binary puzzle. The final output is a fully playable Game Boy ROM compatible with standard emulators. Although some planned features such as weapon upgrades and additional stages were not completed, all core objectives were met. The project demonstrates effective design within the limits of Game Boy hardware while showcasing a complete gameplay loop supported by custom assets, scripts, and documentation.
