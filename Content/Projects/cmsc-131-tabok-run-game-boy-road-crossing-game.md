abstract: Tabok Run is a retro-inspired 2D road-crossing game developed using GB Studio, demonstrating the practical application of low-level computer organization concepts within interactive game logic. The game features precise collision detection, dynamic movement physics, and multi-level progression through a series of increasingly challenging environments. This project exemplifies how machine-level programming principles—including data representation, bitwise operations, control structures, memory management, and array manipulation—integrate into real-time game development. The final deliverable is a fully playable .gb ROM executable compatible with Game Boy emulators, complete with technical documentation and comprehensive architectural analysis.
