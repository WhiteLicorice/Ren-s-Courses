abstract: CTRL+BIT is a 2D educational maze game designed to enhance students' understanding of Assembly mnemonics through interactive gameplay. Developed using C and the Raylib library, the game engages players in navigating dynamically generated mazes while manipulating binary values to unlock gates representing Assembly instructions, including INC, DEC, ROR, ROL, SHL, and SHR. The maze generation employs depth-first search and backtracking algorithms to ensure every maze is solvable while maintaining unique and replayable experiences. Players receive a set of bits that guide their collection strategy to meet the requirements of mnemonic gates, promoting deeper conceptual understanding of Assembly language operations. The implementation successfully combines gameplay, problem-solving, and bit manipulation to create an engaging educational tool that improves critical thinking and mastery of low-level programming concepts. The game demonstrates how gamification can transform traditionally difficult lessons into an interactive learning environment. Compiled to WebAssembly using Emscripten, the game runs efficiently in web browsers with load times under 20 milliseconds for cached assets. The source code, documentation, and deployment artifacts are publicly available on GitHub, enabling reproducibility and extension by future developers.
