abstract: This project presents a Pathfinding Visualizer designed to demonstrate and analyze the performance of various pathfinding algorithms in a grid-based environment. The application visualizes the search process using a wavefront propagation method, providing real-time insight into how different algorithms traverse a graph. Upon locating the target node, the system highlights the resulting path, allowing for immediate visual verification of efficiency. We implemented nine distinct algorithms for comparison, including A*, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Greedy Best-First Search, Bidirectional Search, Weighted A*, Beam Search, and Bidirectional A*. The tool features a fully interactive interface where users can customize grid topology by placing barriers and adjusting start and end coordinates. Additionally, the system includes an automated maze generator to facilitate rapid testing scenarios. To provide quantitative performance metrics, the visualizer calculates and displays the path length, total nodes visited, and execution runtime for each search. This project serves as both an educational tool for understanding algorithmic logic and a benchmarking utility for comparing heuristic and non-heuristic pathfinding strategies.
