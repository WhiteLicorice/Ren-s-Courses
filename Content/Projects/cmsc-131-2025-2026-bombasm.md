abstract: Bombasm is an interactive learning platform that teaches bit manipulation through puzzles requiring users to transform an initial bitstring into a target bitstring using a set of operations. The project originally proposed a full assembly-language simulation with registers and flags, but the scope was reduced to core bit operations due to time and experience constraints. The visual design also shifted from a bomb theme to an analog-computer style to better reflect low-level programming contexts. The final system was delivered on time, implementing all basic bit operations and tutorial levels, while only partially completing advanced puzzle modes. Overall, the project successfully met its primary educational objectives within the refined scope.
