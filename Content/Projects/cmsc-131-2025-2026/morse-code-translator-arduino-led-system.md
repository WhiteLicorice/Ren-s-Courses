abstract: This work presents the design and implementation of a microcontroller-based Morse Code Translation System utilizing an Arduino Uno platform. The system enables character input through a 4×4 matrix keypad employing a T9 multi-tap selection algorithm, which resolves alphabetic characters from limited numeric keys. A 16×2 I2C LCD module provides real-time feedback of user input and system status. The translation process is performed using an indexed lookup table that maps each character to its corresponding Morse code sequence, while precise timing control governs LED-based optical output according to standard Morse code specifications. The complete system was evaluated through functional testing of character recognition, timing accuracy, and signal reliability. Results demonstrate consistent performance across the full A–Z character set and stable optical transmission under varying input rates. The system offers a compact and low-cost platform suitable for instructional use in embedded systems, digital communication principles, and human–machine interaction.
