abstract: jocSING is a low-cost, portable, and user-friendly karaoke prototype system built using the ESP32 microcontroller. The project's purpose is to simulate a commercial karaoke experience while providing real-time singing feedback and a basic scoring mechanism. Its core features include IR remote-controlled song selection from a custom songbook, synchronized lyrics display on a 16x2 LCD screen, audio playback via the DFPlayer Mini MP3 module, and real-time pitch analysis using the INMP441 microphone. The system processes the user's pitch via an autocorrelation algorithm and provides immediate visual feedback through an RGB LED module. The final outcome demonstrates a fully functional, integrated system capable of reliably reading user input, playing back audio, displaying synced lyrics, and analyzing and scoring the user's performance based on pitch consistency and accuracy, meeting all primary functional objectives.
