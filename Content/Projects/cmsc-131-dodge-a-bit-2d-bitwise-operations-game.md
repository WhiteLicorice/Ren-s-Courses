abstract: Technological advances in today's world have significantly influenced the evolution of the gaming industry. Game development has become a powerful medium for learning, making educational content more engaging, interactive, and enjoyable. The purpose of this project is to create a 2D game that incorporates assembly programming concepts using C++ and Raylib, and to compile it into WebAssembly using Emscripten. This project was completed within a one-month timeframe, utilizing freely available assets. The final output is a locally deployable game that runs directly in the browser, featuring smooth and responsive player controls, properly timed lasers, and persistent high scores. By combining low-level programming concepts with modern web technologies, this project demonstrates the potential for creating interactive, browser-based games that are both educational and entertaining.
