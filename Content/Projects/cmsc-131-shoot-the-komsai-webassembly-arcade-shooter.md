abstract: Shoot the Komsai is a high-performance, retro-futuristic arcade shooter designed to highlight the practical advantages and modern capabilities of WebAssembly (WASM) in web-based game development. This project showcases a hybrid architecture that combines a C++ backend which is responsible for core game logic, real-time physics calculations, collision detection, and enemy behavior with a JavaScript, CSS and HTML frontend that manages rendering pipelines, asset handling, audio playback, and user interaction.
