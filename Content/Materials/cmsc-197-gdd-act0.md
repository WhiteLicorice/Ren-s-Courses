Before we dive into the technicalities of nodes, signals, and state machines, we must first establish a **technical baseline**. Game development is a multidisciplinary field that requires a synthesis of software engineering, mathematics, and creative design. As seniors, you already possess a robust toolkit from previous courses. This activity serves to audit that toolkit and align your ambitions with the reality of the semester.

## The Pitch

During our first meeting, every student will be given **5 to 10 minutes** to present their developer profile. Think of this as your elevator pitch to the studio where you want to get hired. You are expected to answer the following:

1. **The Past:** What is the most complex software system you have built to date? This does not have to be a game (e.g., a CMSC 22 project, a web app, or a data structure implementation), but **games are preferred**. In any case, what were the primary architectural challenges you faced?

2. **The Future:** If scope, time, and budget were non-factors, what is the dream game you want to build? Briefly describe the core mechanical and gameplay loop.

3. **The Reality:** Considering we only have one semester, what is a **feasible** version of that dream? What would make it publishable and be worthy of a **1.0 grade**?

**Interactive Format**

As the class is interactive, each student is expected and encouraged to ask questions or provide feedback for each presenter. Use this time to identify potential collaborators.

## Prep

You are not required to bring a formal slide deck, but you are **highly encouraged** to bring visual or auditory aids, as a projector will be provided. This includes:

- Screenshots or video captures of previous projects
- A mood board or reference images for the game you intend to develop
- A GitHub link to a repository you are particularly proud of
- Demonstration of a game you already built, if possible

**Common Pitfalls**

**Avoid:**
- Vague descriptions ("I want to make an RPG")
- Unrealistic scope ("I want to make the next Elden Ring")
- No understanding of technical limitations

**Instead, demonstrate:**
- Specific mechanical vision ("Roguelike w/ Pokemon mechanics, wink wink hehe")
- Awareness of scope ("Core game loop first, polish later")
- Technical feasibility analysis

## Objective

The goal of pre-jamming is twofold:

### 1. Gauge Collective Technical Experience
This allows tailoring the difficulty of machine problems and pacing through the syllabus based on the class' demonstrated capabilities.

### 2. Facilitate Partner Formation
Since all major projects are done in pairs, use this time to identify peers whose:

- **Interests align:** Similar genre preferences or game design philosophies
- **Skills complement:** Systems programmer + UI designer, mathematician + creative designer
- **Work ethic matches:** Similar expectations for commitment and quality

**Partner Selection Strategy**

Look for complementary strengths, not identical skill sets. The best pairs combine different perspectives: algorithmic thinkers with creative designers, optimization experts with UX specialists.

### Deadline

By the next session, all pairs must be submitted to the instructor. If you cannot find a partner, please inform the instructor immediately. GLHF!
